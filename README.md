All scripts for de novo emergence analysis are comprised in the `/scripts` folder. They are ordered in the following order:
1. Genome annotation
2. De novo identification
3. Plotting of the de novo results
4. Integrity analysis and identification of "good" de novo candidates (n = 64)
5. Clustering of the 64 de novo
6. Plotting of the integrity analysis results
7. De novo characterisation, using sequence and structure descriptors
8. De novo characterisation visualisation


The corresponding results are in the `/results` folder.
